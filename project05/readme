Project to test K-Means algorithm against the Iris dataset. 

Run main.rb to run the algorithm. libsqlite 3 is required. 

 The output will be the clusters found by the algorithm. SSE for each cluster, and how many of each class of flower is in that cluster.

 Following output from clusters will be the overall SSE for the clustering.
