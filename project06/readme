My approach to solving the problem:

Initial quick statistics on data:
85 Losers
213 Winners

Sorting Data based on name in a spread sheet seems to form some patterns. There are may runs of + and runs of -'s The runs also seem to be differentiated by the first letter of the first name. 

Most first names that start with C seem to be - while almost all of the D's are +
S's : Most are -

All Thomas's are - however all Tom's are +
